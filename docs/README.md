# 📚 Vulnerability Documentation

Welcome to the security documentation for our **AI Coder Capstone Project**. This section details the vulnerabilities we intentionally introduced into the web application, how each was exploited, and the steps we took to mitigate them. This effort is part of our exploration of offensive and defensive cybersecurity practices, with a focus on using AI tools for assistance.

Each page includes:
- A description of the vulnerability
- A step-by-step demonstration of the exploit
- Mitigation strategies with code snippets
- Testing validation

## 🧠 AI Integration

All vulnerabilities were implemented and patched with the help of AI tools like:
- **ChatGPT** — for code generation, attack vector analysis, and mitigation advice
- **GitHub Copilot** — for boilerplate and implementation scaffolding
